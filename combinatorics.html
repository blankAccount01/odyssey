        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Combinatorics is a branch of mathematics focused on counting, arranging, and combining objects. It plays a crucial role in various fields, including computer science, probability theory, and optimization. This article will explore the fundamental concepts of combinatorics, key principles, and real-world applications.</p>

        <h2>What Is Combinatorics?</h2>
        <p>Combinatorics involves the study of finite or countable discrete structures. It encompasses various topics, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Counting</strong>: Determining the number of ways to select or arrange items.</li>
            <li><strong>Graph Theory</strong>: Analyzing graphs to study the relationships between objects.</li>
            <li><strong>Design Theory</strong>: Exploring combinatorial designs and arrangements.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Key Concepts in Combinatorics</h2>

        <h3>1. Counting Principles</h3>
        <p>Counting principles are the foundation of combinatorics. Here are two essential principles:</p>

        <h4>The Addition Principle</h4>
        <p>If there are <em>m</em> ways to perform one action and <em>n</em> ways to perform another, and these actions cannot occur simultaneously, then there are <em>m + n</em> ways to perform either action.</p>

        <h4>The Multiplication Principle</h4>
        <p>If one action can be performed in <em>m</em> ways and a second independent action can be performed in <em>n</em> ways, then the two actions can be performed in <em>m × n</em> ways.</p>

        <h3>2. Permutations</h3>
        <p>Permutations refer to the arrangement of items in a specific order. The number of permutations of <em>n</em> distinct objects is given by <em>n!</em> (n factorial).</p>
        <div class="example">The permutations of the letters A, B, C are: ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA.</div>

        <h3>3. Combinations</h3>
        <p>Combinations involve selecting items without regard to the order. The number of combinations of <em>r</em> items chosen from <em>n</em> distinct items is given by:</p>
        <div class="formula">C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n - r)!)</div>
        <p>If you want to select 2 letters from the set {A, B, C}, the combinations are: AB, AC, BC.</p>

        <h3>4. Binomial Theorem</h3>
        <p>The binomial theorem provides a way to expand expressions of the form <em>(a + b)<sup>n</sup></em>. It states that:</p>
        <div class="formula">(a + b)<sup>n</sup> = Σ<sub>k=0</sub><sup>n</sup> C(n, k) a<sup>n-k</sup> b<sup>k</sup></div>

        <h2>Applications of Combinatorics</h2>
        <p>Combinatorics has numerous applications in various fields:</p>

        <h3>1. Computer Science</h3>
        <p>In computer algorithms, combinatorial structures are often used to optimize processes, such as sorting and searching data.</p>

        <h3>2. Probability Theory</h3>
        <p>Combinatorial methods are essential in calculating probabilities in scenarios involving random selections or arrangements.</p>

        <h3>3. Game Theory</h3>
        <p>Combinatorial strategies can be applied in competitive games to analyze potential outcomes and improve decision-making.</p>

        <h3>4. Operations Research</h3>
        <p>Combinatorics plays a vital role in resource allocation, scheduling, and logistics optimization, helping businesses make efficient choices.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Combinatorics is a rich and diverse field of mathematics that provides powerful tools for counting, arranging, and analyzing discrete structures. Its principles form the backbone of various real-world applications, making it an essential area of study for mathematicians, scientists, and engineers alike.</p>
